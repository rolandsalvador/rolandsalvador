<h2>:computer: Cybersecurity Projects</h2>

- [Microsoft Azure Hacker Honeypot](https://github.com/rolandsalvador/azurehoneypot)
  <br />
  I created a virtual machine hosted on Microsoft Azure to act as a honeypot for attackers attempting to use the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to log in. All firewalls on 
  the virtual machine were disabled, and the Azure security group associated with it allowed any traffic to pass through.

- [Wazuh SIEM/XDR Complete Home Lab](https://github.com/rolandsalvador/wazuh)
  <br />
  I configured Wazuh, a free and open-source SIEM and XDR. I set up four virtual machines to simulate a small network. I used an Ubuntu 22.04 machine to act as the Wazuh 
  server, and then used an Ubuntu 22.04, Windows 10 Pro, and Windows 11 machine to act as the Wazuh agents.

- [Nessus Vulnerability Scanner Home Lab](https://github.com/rolandsalvador/nessus)
  <br />
  I installed Nessus Essentials on my computer and used a new Windows 11 virtual machine as the scanning target. After successfully running a credentialed scan, 
  I remediated a few of the vulnerabilities that were found.

<h2>:floppy_disk: Other IT Projects</h2>

- [Active Directory Domain Services Home Lab](https://github.com/rolandsalvador/activedirectory)
  <br />
  I configured Active Directory Domain Services, a domain controller, and a client computer. The domain controller acts as a DHCP server for the virtual machine subnet, 
  VMnet0. The domain controller also contains a NIC for public use to connect to the internet.

- [Small Office Network (Part 1) -  Created From Scratch](https://github.com/rolandsalvador/officenetwork)
  <br />
  I created a small office network from scratch in Cisco Packet Tracer. This repository is the first part of two in my small office network project. Part 1 is creating the 
  network from scratch. The network is a two-tier (or collapsed core) design with a PC, laptop, phone, server, wireless LAN controller, and lightweight access point.

- [Small Office Network (Part 2) - Configuration](https://github.com/rolandsalvador/officenetwork2)
  <br />
  Part 2 is where I configure the Part 1 network to use protocols and technologies such as DHCP, DNS, IPv4 and IPv6, OSPF, STP, HSRP, VLANs, Firewalls, Wireless, and much 
  more.

  <br />
  This game is a remake of Dance Dance Revolution (DDR), made from the ground up in Unity with C#. This game was a project that was due in my CS583 (3D Game Programming) 
  class at San Diego State University.
